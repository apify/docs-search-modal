# @apify/docs-search-modal

This project contains a React component that renders a search modal for Apify documentation (using **Algolia's Autocomplete**).

In case you want to create something similar for your project, feel free to check out the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/apify/docs-search-modal)!

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
yarn
cd web
yarn
yarn dev
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5173`. 
HMR is enabled by default, so you can see the changes you make in the search modal code in real-time.
